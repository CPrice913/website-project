                <h2>Skills</h2>
                <p><strong>Technical Skills</strong></p>
	            <p><u>Windows OS:</u> there has been a Windows computer in my household since 1999. I have personal experience using Windows for approximately 25 years.<br>
	           <u>Mac OS:</u> I have a fundamental level of knowledge about Mac OS, again in a personal experience, as well as iPad OS and iOS.<br>
	            <u>Linux:</u> I have a very limited knowledge of Linux; mostly in relation to school labs and projects. It is something I am very interested in to further my experience with. <br>
	            <u>Mobile devices:</u> I personally have an Android device and therefore find myself to say I have a much better grasp of that OS than I would say I have for iOS, but I would still say I am confident in my knowledge and abilities to be able to troubleshoot any mobile device.<br>
	            <u>3-D Printers:</u> I have had the privilege to be able to build a 3-D printer from scratch. The Prusa Mk4 model took about a week to fully assemble. I did most of the hands-on building while my partner did the research and reading and relaying of instructions.<br>
	            <u>PC Building:</u> I have also been able to help build 3 separate PCs from the ground up. It was a very daunting task the first time and has only gotten easier and more fun each successive time. <br>
	            <u>Programming Languages:</u> I have a very top-level knowledge and experience with Python. I am very recently getting into HTML and CSS</p><br>
                <p><strong>Soft Skills</strong></p>
	            <p>Organization, problem solving, collaboration, critical thinking, communication, and initiative</p>
